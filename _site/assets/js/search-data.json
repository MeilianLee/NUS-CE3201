The first three will focus on data analysis, which will be followed by another three lectures on data visualization. | Lectures will be held live on Zoom and will be recorded. I will also provide additional face-to-face support if you prefer to come to the classroom to attend the lectures. | . Tutorials . | We will have 6 tutorials in total. One tutorial per week. | Tutorials are prepared in Jupyter Notebook format and are fully available online. | This means you can do these tutorials anywhere (but with stable internet) you want. We understand that sometimes programming and debugging could be cumbersome. So if you prefer to seek face-to-face support, you are welcome to come to the computer lab during the tutorial session. In the meantime, we will also offer online support through Zoom. | You can also get help with tutorials during office hours or through emails. But the best place to get help is the weekly tutorial session. | . Office Hours . | Weekly fixed office hours can be found on the Schedule tab, and will be held either virtually or in-person depending on your needs. | I have an open-door policy. So feel free to drop by my office for any reason, including course material clarification, questions on tutorials, assignments, and projects, or even just to hang out. | . ",
