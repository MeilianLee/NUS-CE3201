## About CE3201
This course aims to introduce basic data science concepts and visualization techniques to students who
are interested in climate, buildings, environment, etc. Students will gain hands-on experience in terms of how to mine, model and visualize data
to tell a compelling story of global challenges (e.g., emerging climate crisis).

### Learning Outcomes
- An understanding of visualization techniques including data models, graphical perception and methods for visual encoding and interaction.
- Exposure to several common data domains and corresponding analysis tasks, including multivariate data, networks, text and cartography.
- Practical experience building visuals from data using open-source tools and libraries, and deriving sound interpretations from them.

### Prerequisites
This module requires no prior knowledge of progamming and only basic concepts of statistics. 

## Hybrid Format
### Lecture
TBD. 

### Tutorial
TBD.

## Textbooks and Materials

- Primary textbook: [**pyCIVIL**](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/python-climate-visuals) (**py**thon **C**l**I**mate **VI**sua**L**s), 
  a free online textbook that is currently under development.
  Your comments and suggestions are welcome. 
- Supplementary textbook: [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/). (free online book; although based on `R`, 
  but it is a great guide to make fabulous visualizations that correctly reflect the data). 
- A computer.
- Stable internet connection.
